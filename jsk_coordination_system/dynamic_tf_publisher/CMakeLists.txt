# From https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_recognition/pull/2345
# Install header files directly into ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_INCLUDE_DESTINATION}.
# If the package has setup.py and modules under src/${PROJECT_NAME}/,
# install python executables directly into ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}.
# However, if it doesn't have setup.py, directories including python executables
# should be installed recursively into ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION}.
# Also, other directories like 'launch' or 'sample' must be installed
# recursively into ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION}.
# Be careful that 'launch' and 'launch/' are different: the former is directory
# and the latter is each content.
